This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to the use of innerHTML.  The `bug.html` file contains the incorrect code, which attempts to directly insert a JavaScript object into the HTML using `innerHTML`. This leads to an error because `innerHTML` expects a string value. The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected approach, illustrating how to correctly insert object data into the HTML by stringifying the object or accessing its properties.
